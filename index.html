        <h2>Hello.</h2
        <p class="intro">I'm so excited to be here at DevPoint Labs! For the past 10 years or so, I've spent most of my time being a mom
to my two children, who are 9 and 7. Now that they are in school most of the day, I'm very much looking forward to starting
a new career in something that I truly enjoy - coding.</p>

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <p class="">After graduating from Weber State University with a B.S. in Zoology, I spent 5 years studying nesting success of shorebirds
around the Great Salt Lake. It is this job where I learned my strong teamwork and communication skills. Once my children were born, I
worked retail here and there, and started taking prerequisite courses to prepare for acceptance into the dental hygiene program at Weber State University.
That is, until I heard about DevPoint Labs. I knew immediately that this is where I want to be and exactly what I want to be doing!</p>

          <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p>I've been married to my husband for 17 years, and I enjoy spending lots of time with my family. We love gaming together, being outside - hiking, swimming, birdwatching,
          traveling to new places, or riding our bikes. I love crafting and creating things, and I recently started working with polymer clay to make jewelry.
